# film_project

This was part of a project that explored the use of collapsible corporations in the form of production companies in the film making business. The collapsible corporation would be used to take advantage of a tax loop that allowed investors to see profit returns in a preferential manner. The data comes from the American Film Instituteâ€™s AFI Catalog that includes all theatrically American films released from 1893 to 1993. To access the database, we had to use a JupyterLab Python environment within ProQuest. The database stored the data as XML files which required the Python package BeautifulSoup to read XML tag information to convert each film page into a row in a Pandas data frame.
